\section{Research Plan }\label{research-plan}


\subsection{Objective:}\label{objective}
  
My long-term goal is to develop and validate a quantitative measure of healthy aging that depends solely on structured data universally available in electronic medical record systems or that can be linked to them (e.g. census and social security data). Such a measure would be important for research because it could provide rapid and granular feedback about the effectiveness of anti-frailty interventions instead of depending on measuring time elapsed until an event such as mortality or loss of independence. 

My short-term goal for this study is to establish that a statistically valid adjustment of coefficients will improve the predictive accuracy of mFI as well as its agreement with RAI-A \cite{Isharwal_2016,Melin_2015}. I will then determine whether mFI \cite{Rockwood_2005}, as adapted to NSQIP \cite{Tsiouris_2013}, is also an accurate predictor of two long-term outcomes that I have already linked to patient data: income from census data, which I have linked on patient addresses and mortality from the social security death master file which I have linked on social security numbers (in addition to some deaths already being reported directly in the EMR). Finally, I will determine whether an mFI analogue calculated on EMR data correlates with a NSQIP-based mFI on the same set of patients, and whether it exhibits convergent validity for predicting long-term outcomes on those patients. 

The work I propose will create the means by which mFI, a frailty measure used by geriatricians as well as surgeons, could be calculated for any patient, not only those selected for inclusion into the NSQIP registry. Furthermore, it could be calculated at any time, not just pursuant to surgery, and without relying on an in-person assessment, performance test, or questionnaire.

\subsection{Rationale:}\label{rationale}
In 2013, an international expert panel organized by the American Medical Directors Association and including among its members Linda Fried and Ken Rockwood, originators of the two main schools of thought in frailty metrics field, published a consensus report \cite{Morley_2013} stating that frailty is a clinically important syndrome that is tractable to interventions and recommending that all patients older than 70 be screened for frailty. Individuals identified as frail are especially likely benefit from individualized exercise regimens, anti-inflammatory drugs, and closer coordination between specialists and primary care physicians \citep{16392724}.

Physical assessment is time-consuming and some measures such as chair rises and walking speed \cite{10811152} could place stress on already vulnerable patients. Even questionnaires can place a significant burden on the health system when scaled over hundreds of thousands of patients. Ideally an algorithm would calculate the initial frailty score for every patient based on their electronic medical record. Patients with scores out
