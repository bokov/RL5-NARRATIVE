\section{Research Plan }\label{research-plan}


\subsection{Objective:}\label{objective}
  
To develop and validate a quantitative measure of healthy aging that depends solely on structured data universally available in electronic medical record systems or that can be linked to them (e.g. en),
using two different validated frailty metrics as starting points. This
aging marker could then be used as a proxy for aging in retrospective
and observational studies, as well as to inform medical and surgical
decisions.
