\section{Research Plan }\label{research-plan}


\subsection{Objective:}\label{objective}
  
To develop and validate a quantitative measure of healthy aging that depends solely on structured available in electronic medical record systems ,
using two different validated frailty metrics as starting points. This
aging marker could then be used as a proxy for aging in retrospective
and observational studies, as well as to inform medical and surgical
decisions.
