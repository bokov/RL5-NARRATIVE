\section{Research Plan }\label{research-plan}


\subsection{Objective:}\label{objective}
  
My long-term goal is to develop and validate a quantitative measure of healthy aging that depends solely on structured data universally available in electronic medical record systems or that can be linked to them (e.g. census social security data). Such a measure would be important for research because it could provide rapid and granular feedback about the effectiveness of anti-frailty 
using two different validated frailty metrics as starting points. This
aging marker could then be used as a proxy for aging in retrospective
and observational studies, as well as to inform medical and surgical
decisions.
