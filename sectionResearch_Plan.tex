\section{Research Plan }\label{research-plan}


\subsection{Objective:}\label{objective}
  
My long-term goal is to develop and validate a quantitative measure of healthy aging that depends solely on structured data universally available in electronic medical record systems or that can be linked to them (e.g. census social security data). Such a measure would be important for research because it could provide rapid and granular feedback about the effectiveness of anti-frailty interventions instead of depending on measuring time elapsed until an event such as mortality or loss of independence.

My short-term goal for this study is to establish that, with proper adjustment of effect sizes the agreement of mFI and RAI-A will be improved
