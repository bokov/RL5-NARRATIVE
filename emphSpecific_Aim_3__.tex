\subsection{Clinical Impact}\label{clinical-impact}
There are two main types of frailty scores used in geriatric research and clinical practice: the Fried frailty phenotype \cite{Fried_2001} and the Rockwood Frailty Index \cite{Mitnitski_2001}. The frailty phenotype is anchored on weakness, sarcopenia, diminished mobility as recorded via patient questionnaire or an physical assessment performed by a physician. The frailty index is based on the deficit accumulation theory and is calculated as a simple unweighted sum of selected diagnoses, conditions, and dichotomized lab values, corrected for missing observations. The actual choice of variables is less important than them spanning multiple clinical domains \cite{Searle_2008}. In fact Rockwood indices constructed by \textit{randomly} selecting from a set of facially valid variables exhibit a high degree of agreement with each other \cite{Mitnitski_2001}.

The modified frailty index (mFI) is a variant of the Rockwood Index which uses 11 variables from the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) registry, and has been effectively used to predict complications for many different types of surgery \cite{Uppal_2015,Tsiouris_2013,Bellamy_2017,22491599,23711971,23949353}. Registries such as ACS NSQIP offer the advantage of high quality expert-curated data with clearly defined guidelines and good inter-rater reliability \cite{Shiloach_2010}. Yet they have the following limitations in their usefulness to research and clinical decision support
