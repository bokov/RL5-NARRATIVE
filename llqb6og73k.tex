I also followed the process for developing a frailty measure recommended by Rockwood \cite{Rockwood_2005}. This frailty metric is even more strongly correlated with both outcomes and even in this small sample has a similar probability distribution to the original frailty measure derived by Rockwood \cite{Mitnitski_2001} in a completely different dataset with different component variables, but chosen using the same methodology.

\section{(Temporary Storage, Not Part of Final Document)}\label{ammo}
There are two main types of frailty scores used in geriatric research and clinical practice: the Fried frailty phenotype \cite{Fried_2001} and the Rockwood Frailty Index \cite{Mitnitski_2001}. The frailty phenotype is anchored on weakness, sarcopenia, diminished mobility as recorded via patient questionnaire or an physical assessment performed by a physician. The frailty index is based on the deficit accumulation theory and is calculated as a simple unweighted sum of selected diagnoses, conditions, and dichotomized lab values, corrected for missing observations. The actual choice of variables is less important than them spanning multiple clinical domains \cite{Searle_2008}.
